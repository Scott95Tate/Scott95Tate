## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a data scientist with expertise in R and statistical modeling, primarily focused on building predictive analytics solutions in the healthcare domain. This repository serves as a space to share projects, code, and research that reflect my passion for using data to support better decision-making and outcomes in health-related fields.

My work often involves working with large, complex datasetsâ€”from electronic health records to clinical trial dataâ€”where I apply a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and develop predictive models. Using Râ€™s robust ecosystem of packages like tidyverse, caret, randomForest, and survival, I build solutions that are both analytically sound and practically applicable.

In the healthcare space, precision and clarity matter. I prioritize transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility in all my models. Whether Iâ€™m forecasting patient outcomes, identifying risk factors, or helping optimize treatment pathways, my goal is to deliver insights that are both accurate and actionable. I also focus on effective data visualization using tools like ggplot2 and shiny to communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.

This repository includes predictive modeling projects, reproducible research, custom R functions, and data visualizations. Many of these are based on real-world healthcare problems, showcasing a blend of domain knowledge and technical skills in applied statistics and machine learning.

I welcome collaboration, feedback, and discussions around data science in healthcare. Whether you're a fellow researcher, data scientist, or healthcare professional interested in analytics, I hope you find something useful or inspiring here.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and feel free to explore the code, open issues, or connect if you're interested in working together on data-driven healthcare innovation.
